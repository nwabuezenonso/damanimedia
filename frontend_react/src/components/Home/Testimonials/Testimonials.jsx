            <p>“Saying my vows to the love of my life and having beautiful and timeless wedding photos were the only things that mattered to me on my big day. I saw Damanis work and knew instantly that I did not want anyone else but him to have my pictures taken. A friendly and professional young man who easily managed the hassle, knowing both my traditional and white wedding were done on the same day. I still talk about how fantastic my photos are- A total dream! I always recommend him to anyone I know who is getting married.”</p>
